How to Brew Coffee in a Moka Pot

A Moka pot is a straightforward stovetop brewing device that generates velvety smooth coffee by passing pressurized boiling water upward through fine coffee grounds. The simplicity of a Moka pot makes it appeal to veterans and newcomers alike, leveling the playing field so you can enjoy a perfect cup of coffee without earning a Master’s Degree in Coffee Science.

What You’ll Need:
A coffee grinder 
Coffee beans
Moka Pot
Water

Brew Time: 
Approx. 5 minutes


Ready? Here’s our quick Moka pot brewing guide:

1. Grind your coffee to a fine grind, the same size that you would use in an espresso machine. Grind about 20 grams of coffee per cup that you want to brew.
 
2. Unscrew and separate the bottom of the Moka pot from the top and remove the basket. Fill the bottom of the Moka pot with water, ensuring the water level stays below the steam release valve.
You have a choice: use cold water, or pre-boil water and add hot water directly to the Moka pot. Some brewers prefer one method to the other. If you choose to boil water and add it to your Moka pot while hot be cautious when transferring the boiling water from your kettle. Also, keep in mind that the heating and brewing processes will take less time in the steps below.

3. Add the coffee grounds to the filter basket. Shake the basket gently or use your finger to evenly disperse the grounds to make them level.
 
4. Insert the filter basket into the bottom compartment and screw the top back onto the Moka pot.
 
5. Place the Moka pot on the stovetop. Turn on the burner and set it to medium heat.
It is possible to use excessive heat and cook the coffee beans, spoiling your pot of coffee. Pay attention to the temperature you use and adjust as necessary with subsequent brews.
 
6. Watch the coffee brew. The right pressure should push a steady stream of coffee through the upper chamber once the water has boiled. If you see the coffee practically explode like a geyser the heat is too high, and if the coffee is bubbling up occasionally it is too slow.
 
7. Remove the Moka pot from heat once you hear a hissing, bubbling sound indicating that the coffee has finished brewing. Once your Moka pot coffee has finished brewing simply pour yourself a cup, add sugar and cream if you like, and marvel at your handiwork as you enjoy a sip of rich, steaming coffee.
