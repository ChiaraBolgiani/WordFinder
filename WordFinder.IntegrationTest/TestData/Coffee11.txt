The Moka Pot: A Brief History

The Moka pot, called a “caffettiera” in its native Italy, was invented in 1933 by Luigi De Ponti. The design was purchased, perfected, and patented by Alfonso Bialetti shortly after, a man who confusingly is also not named “Moka” (the Moka pot gets its name from the Yemenite city of Mocha). 
Bialetti, who had existing business ties in the aluminum and metalworking industries, decided that all Moka pots should be manufactured from aluminum. At the time this was considered an innovation, but keep in mind while using a Moka pot that aluminum retains heat and can burn you if handled improperly.
